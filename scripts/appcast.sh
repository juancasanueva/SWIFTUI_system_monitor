# Build System Monitor's Sparkle appcast for one published release.
#
# What this script is allowed to do: fetch the live feed, fetch and verify the
# pinned signing tool, sign one zip, merge one item, and write the result to an
# output directory. What it deliberately cannot do: publish, tag, retract, or
# select a repository. There is no `git` and no `gh` in it, and
# `AppcastScriptContractTests` asserts both — the release workflow's guarantee
# that it can only ever *create* a release is only worth something if the
# scripts it calls cannot quietly widen it.
#
# It never traces itself. Command tracing would echo the signing pipeline into
# the job log, and the signing pipeline is where the private key is.
#
# Environment contract:
#   VERSION              marketing version, without the leading v (1.2.3)
#   BUILD_NUMBER         the build number the release was archived with
#   GITHUB_REF_NAME      the tag; a hyphen in it means prerelease, and no item
#   ASSET_URL            the published zip's download URL
#   ZIP_PATH             the local zip that was published, to be signed
#   FEED_URL             the live feed, fetched so history is preserved
#   OUTPUT_DIR           where appcast.xml is written; never the repository tree
#   SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY  the EdDSA private key, read on **stdin only**
#
# Run it by hand exactly as CI runs it: every input is an environment variable
# and nothing is discovered from the checkout.
