#
# release.sh — archive, export, package, notarize, staple and verify a
# Developer ID build of System Monitor.
#
# This is the build sequence, not a publishing path. It contains no version
# control and no release-management invocation of any kind, so it can neither
# select a repository nor publish, tag, or retract anything, whatever directory
# it is run from. Publication lives only in .github/workflows/release.yml.
# It also never creates, unlocks, or imports into a keychain: the workflow owns
# credentials, this file owns the build, and running these exact commands
# locally is what makes the local rehearsal a rehearsal rather than an
# approximation of one.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release.sh <archive|export|package|notarize|staple|verify|all>
#
# Environment:
#   VERSION            marketing version, e.g. 1.0.0                — all phases
#   BUILD_NUMBER       CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION            — archive/export/verify
#   ASC_KEY_PATH       App Store Connect API key (.p8) path
#   ASC_KEY_ID         App Store Connect API key id
#   ASC_ISSUER_ID      App Store Connect issuer id
#                      — notarize, and archive/export when SIGNING_STYLE=automatic
#   SIGNING_STYLE      manual (default) or automatic
#   RELEASE_BUILD_DIR  output root, default "build" (excluded from the repository)
#
# Signing style: `manual` signs the archive directly with the Developer ID
# Application identity already present in the keychain and asks Apple for
# nothing. `automatic` lets Xcode manage signing through the App Store Connect
# key, which on a fresh CI runner mints a new "Created via API" Mac Development
# certificate on every run; Apple caps those at ten per team.

phases:
  archive    Build a Release archive stamped with VERSION / BUILD_NUMBER
  export     Export a Developer ID app, then gate its version and architecture
  package    ditto the exported app into System-Monitor-<version>.zip
  notarize   Submit the archive and wait for Apple's verdict
  staple     Staple the ticket, then repackage so the asset carries it
  verify     Re-check every claim against the copy extracted from the zip
  all        Run the six phases above in order (the local rehearsal)
